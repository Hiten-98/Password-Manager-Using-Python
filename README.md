# Password-Manager-Using-Python

In this project I have built a Password Manager using GUI in Python. This project might look simple but there are some important concepts covered such as
1. Tkinter GUI Module
2. Python Dictionary
3. Working with JSON files

And also you can create your own passwoard by just clicking on **Generate Password**.
To generate password I have made different program by name **password_generator**
